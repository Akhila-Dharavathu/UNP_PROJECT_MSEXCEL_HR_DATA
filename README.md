Completed this project as a part of Value Added Course with United Network professionals (UNP). In this project I got the vast data off HR Employee attrition data.

- In the data attrition is by various causes like :- 
    1. Attrition by job satisfaction
     2. Attrition by Age , marital status , single.
    3. Attrition by monthly income
  4.  Attrition by educational background
    5. Attrition by  overtime.. and many more
